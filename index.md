## About Me
-
### Hi, I'm Frame, a guy who likes learning new stuff, playing video games, play sports and coding. I am not new to computer stuff, I was coding in [Unity](https://unity.com/),

## I recently learned how to edit pictures and videos with [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/ca_fr/products/photoshop.html), I'm not that good tho. I really like to play horror games with friends too
## I also recently learned how to code in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) and now I'm a pro Scratcher.
