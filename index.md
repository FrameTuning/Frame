## About Me
-
### Hi, I'm Frame, a guy who likes learning new stuff, playing video games, play sports and coding. I am not new to computer stuff, I am coding in [Unity](https://unity.com/) since im 11,

## I recently learned how to edit pictures and videos with [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/ca_fr/products/photoshop.html), I'm not that good tho. I really like to play horror games with friends too
## I also recently learned how to code in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) and now I'm a pro Scratcher.

## I didn't really liked [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) because of how easy it looks, but I tried to make a simple 2D Platformer game. It wasn't easy at all because there is no built in physics like [Unity](https://unity.com/), there is also no built in camera system like [Cinemachine](https://unity.com/fr/unity/features/editor/art-and-design/cinemachine) so it was really hard for me to make a 2D Side-scrolling platformer game in Scratch. One day I went on a Scratch [Discussion Forum](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/470021/) with a lot of extension like [Box2D](https://github.com/griffpatch/scratch-gui) wich is kind of a Physics Addon. So I was really happy to find a Physics Addon / Extension. But I didn't have the luck of finding a Camera Extension. But now I'm the one who's trying to make one.
